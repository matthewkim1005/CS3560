How to use code:

1. Run in a java IDE
2. The question type is randomized into 3 different questions: Mulitple Choice, True or False, and Choose all that apply.
3. The number of students in the class is randomized from 5-50 students.
4. Running the program will give one of these questions at random so you may have to run it multiple times to get all of the questions.
5. The output should include the student and their respective ID String and the answer that they chose.
6. The output also includes the number of answers that the whole class submitted.
